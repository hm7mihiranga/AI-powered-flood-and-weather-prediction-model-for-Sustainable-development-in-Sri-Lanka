## Introduction

Clouds are crucial in influencing weather patterns, and understanding their organization can help us predict rainfall. In this project, you aim to classify cloud formations from satellite images to predict whether it will rain or not. By identifying specific cloud types, such as those associated with rain, you can improve the accuracy of weather predictions.</br></br>

Using satellite images provided by NASA's Worldview, captured by the MODIS instrument on the `TERRA` and `AQUA` satellites, your model will classify different cloud patterns and assess whether they are likely to produce rain. The cloud formations are labeled based on their structures, with patterns like `Fish, Flower, Gravel,` and `Sugar` providing insights into the type of weather they may bring.</br></br>

The labeled images were created by a team of scientists through a collaborative effort, marking areas where different cloud types appear. By segmenting and analyzing these formations, your model will predict whether rainfall is likely in a given area based on the cloud patterns detected.</br></br>

This project contributes to improving weather forecasting and helps scientists better understand the relationship between cloud organization and rainfall.</br></br>
